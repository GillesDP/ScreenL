## üëÄ About the project
This landing page website was built for ScreenL, a business that offers a real time customer feedback system to other businesses. You've probably seen it around in restaurants or tank stations; a tablet mounted on the wall asking you to leave feedback on their lavatory. ScreenL is a supplier of this software. ScreenL came to me with a problem: "Our current website is rather B2C aimed, while we want it to attract businesses." Clear problem which needed to be fixed.

## üéì Experience
For this project I decided to use regular HTML/CSS combined with Bootstrap. It was at this time that I created the [Templance](https://github.com/GillesDP/Templance) repository. A template that would allow me to setup these type of sites much faster. With this project I got the hang of how SASS works behind the scenes, and was able to implement effective stylesheets by reducing the amount of duplicated code.
